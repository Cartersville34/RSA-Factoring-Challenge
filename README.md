The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem. This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encryption. The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption. The RSA algorithm is asymmetric, which means that the encryption and decryption keys are different.

# RSA Factoring Challenge:

The RSA Factoring Challenge was a challenge set up by RSA Security in 1991 to encourage the development of faster factoring algorithms, which are important for breaking the RSA cryptosystem. The challenge involved factoring a large integer that was the product of two prime numbers, and the prize was $200,000.

**Mission/Objective:**
We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.

## General Requirements
* You can choose the language of your choice, though this project was written in python language
* All the files was interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files ends with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly **#!/usr/bin/env python3**
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All files are executable
* All coded used the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)*

## List of files and description:
